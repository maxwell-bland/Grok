Symbolic execution. Execute the function symbolically, and build up a symbolic
expression that represents the output of the function, in terms of a bunch of
variables (unknowns) that represent the inputs to the function. Then build a
formula by setting that expression equal to the desired output, feed that
formula to a SMT solver and ask the solver to find a satisfying assignment for
the formula.
